                    <h2>Master T'boli Weaver</h2>
                    <p>Lang Dulay (August 3, 1928 – April 30, 2015) was a renowned Filipino traditional weaver from Lake Sebu, South Cotabato, and a member of the T’boli people. She began weaving at the age of 12, and over time it became her life’s vocation. Through her intricate patterns and strict adherence to traditional weaving techniques, she conveyed cultural narratives and helped preserve T’boli heritage. From childhood, she dreamed of establishing a school in her community where people could learn, refine, and perfect their traditional art.</p>

                    <h2>Filipino Metalsmith and Sculptor</h2>
                    <p>Eduardo Mutuc was born in October 12, 1949 with nine sibligs in Apalit, Pampanga. He is a known metalsmith who dedicated his life in making religious and secular works in wood, silver, and bronze. Mutuc initially worked as a farmer and later turned to woodcarving as a steady livelihood. However, life did not go as planned, and he earned as little as ₱3.00 a day. A turning point came when he was taught how to do silver plating and Monsignor Fidelis Limcauco commissioned him to create a tabernacle. Through this opportunity, Mutuc discovered his passion for crafting artworks for cathedrals, which would later define his artistic career.</p>
